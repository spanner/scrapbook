  Against all the odds, the

  exists. We've built it in a day and a bit, so please accept our apologies in advance for the bits that fall off.

  The scrapbook is a place for you to put things that interest you, express something useful or provoke an interesting reaction. 
  This first version can take text and images, show reactions and attach comments. Much more will follow, including audio and video,
  longer documents and various ways to review and browse the collection.

%p
  There is only one rule: You can't see anyone else's reaction until you have given your own.

  We will prime the system with interesting fragments from your first round of correspondence, but please feel free (indeed, compelled) to add more stuff.

%p
  If there are any problems - there will be problems - please let me know immediately by writing to will@spanner.org or replying to this message.

  best wishes,
